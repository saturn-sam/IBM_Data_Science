Data visualization is the process of presenting data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to help people understand and analyze data easily. 

Data visualization has diverse use cases, such as in business, science, healthcare, and finance. 

It is important to follow best practices, such as selecting appropriate visualizations for the data being presented, choosing colors and fonts that are easy to read and interpret, and minimizing clutter.

There are various types of plots commonly used in data visualization.

Line plots capture trends and changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and fluctuations.

Bar plots compare categories or groups, providing a visual comparison of their values.

Scatter plots explore relationships between variables, helping us identify correlations or trends.

Box plots display the distribution of data, showcasing the median, quartiles, and outliers.

Histograms illustrate the distribution of data within specific intervals, allowing us to understand its shape and concentration.
