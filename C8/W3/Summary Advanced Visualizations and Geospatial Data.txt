Folium is a data visualization library in Python that helps people visualize geospatial data. 

With Folium, you can create maps of different styles, such as street-level maps, stamen maps, and more. 

A feature of Folium is that you can create different map styles using the tiles parameter.

With Folium, you can easily add markers on maps.

The ‘location’ parameter specifies the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center point of the map.

Markers play a vital role in enhancing interactivity and adding context to maps.

The folium.Marker() function specifies location parameters.

The popup parameter provides a label upon being clicked.

Markers can be created using “feature group.”

A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable.

When creating a choropleth map, Folium requires a GeoJson file that includes geospatial data of the region.

The Mapbox Bright Tileset displays the name of every country when used on a map.
